# WillItPrint
A MATLAB-based GUI for finding possible issues with a chosen STL file and build orientation

All the files should be downloaded and saved to the same folder. Open up MATLAB and navigate to the folder where you've saved the Will It Print files. I wrote this code in MATLAB 2017b, so compatibility in other versions may vary. You need to have MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox installed, because the Will It Print code calls on some of those built-in functions. Will It Print has a GUI, which can be launced by typing "willitprint" without quotes into MATLAB's command window.
